      <description>Master&amp;rsquo;s degree research project (Apr 2016 - May 2018) I was supervised by Dr. Fábio Gonçalves Daura-Jorge and co-supervised by Dr. Mauricio Cantor, with a 2-year scholarship provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Education (CAPES).
Abstract In Laguna, southern Brazil, some individuals of a bottlenose dolphin population (Tursiops truncatus) forage in cooperation with artisanal fishermen. The social structure of this dolphin population is coupled to this specialized foraging tactic, in which social modules are defined by individuals that often or rarely forage in cooperation with fishermen.</description>
