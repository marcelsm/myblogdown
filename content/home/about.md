# About me

Hi, there! I am a PhD student in Ecology at [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](https://ufsc.br/). Supervised by professor Dr. [Fábio G. Daura-Jorge](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7945592097983692) and co-supervised by [Dr. Mauricio Cantor](https://cantor.weebly.com/), I am seeking my PhD degree by studying how the individual variation in dolphins that forage with artisanal fishermen influence the population dynamics.

I am also a researcher associate of the [Aquatic Mammals Lab (LAMAq)](http://lamaq.ufsc.br) research group, at [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](https://ufsc.br/), Florianópolis, Brazil. I am most interested in behavioural ecology and the role of individual variation in behavior and it's implications to the population level. I am also interested in how human populations interact with marine wildlife, and how both humans and animals can benefit from conservation. I had the opportunity to address such interesting topics using as a model the population of bottlenose dolphins that forages in cooperation with fishermen in Laguna, southern Brazil.
