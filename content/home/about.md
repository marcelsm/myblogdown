# About me

Hi, there! I am a PhD student in Ecology at [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](https://ufsc.br/). I am supervised by professor [Dr. Fábio G. Daura-Jorge](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7945592097983692) and co-supervised by [Dr. Mauricio Cantor](https://cantor.weebly.com/). In 2019, I was granted a joint Brazil-Germany scholarship from CAPES and DAAD to join the [Farine Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/drfarine/home) at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour](https://www.ab.mpg.de/) to work on the Dolphin-Fishers project. I am seeking my Ph.D. degree by investigating how individual differences in dolphins that forage with artisanal fishers contributes to the benefits accrued in this unique cooperation, and how such differences can ultimately influence population dynamics.

I am also a researcher associate of the [Aquatic Mammals Lab (LAMAq)](http://lamaq.ufsc.br) research group, at [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](https://ufsc.br/), Florianópolis, Brazil. I am most interested in behavioural ecology and the role of individual differences in behavior and it's implications to the population level. I am also interested in how human populations interact with marine wildlife, and how both humans and animals can benefit from conservation. I had the opportunity to address such interesting topics using as a model the population of bottlenose dolphins that forages in cooperation with fishermen in Laguna, southern Brazil.
